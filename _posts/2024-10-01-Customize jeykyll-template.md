This [template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) is originally developed by [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali). Many open source contributors have contributed ans actively participated in this project. Main key feature of this website include, very beautiful and quick hostable website, rooms for customization and very new concepts of website development. I came to know about this template from [Invictus](https://mabhay3420.github.io/) which is developed by [Abhay Mishra](https://github.com/mabhay3420).

Checkout this [guide](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/) for installation. More detailed guide is coming soon.
