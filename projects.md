### MaterialSlider
- Category: Openharmony Library
- Language: Extended typescript (eTS)
- Utilities: DevEco Studio

This [open source library](https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony/MaterialSliders) was developed during my internship at huawei. This is my first step towards open source contribution. Typescript and object oriented programming were extensively used in this project. I was guided by [Huawei's Applib Group](https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony) and got a chance to interact with experienced industry leaders
