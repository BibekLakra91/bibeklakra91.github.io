This <a href="https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony/MaterialSliders">open source library</a> was developed during my internship at huawei. This is my first step towards open source contribution. Typescript and object oriented programming were extensively used in this project. I was guided by <a href="https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony">Huawei's Applib Group</a> and got a chance to interact with experienced industry leaders
