### MaterialSlider
- Category: Openharmony Library
- Language: Extended typescript (eTS)
- Utilities: DevEco Studio

<div style="text-align : justify">
This <a href="https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony/MaterialSliders">open source library</a> was developed during my internship at huawei. This is my first step towards open source contribution. Typescript and object oriented programming were extensively used in this project. I was guided by <a href="https://github.com/Applib-OpenHarmony">Huawei's Applib Group</a> and got a chance to interact with experienced industry leaders

## Graph Combinatorics
- Category: Graph Theory, Discrete Maths, Analytic techniques in Graph
<!-- <div style="text-align : justify"> -->
- Understood graphs from Discrete Mathematics perspective. Analyzed various Graph Combinatoric techniques
- Learned various techniques of Extremal Combinatorics such as the characteristic function of graph, the Extremal
Graphs corresponding to n, natural number and H, Tur´an’s Theorem about the extremal number corresponding to H,
the complete graph on r vertices, the Erd˝os–Stone Theorem, Pseudorandom Graphs and the Regularity Lemma
- Analyzed the Graph Polymorphism and calculated the presence of desired structure in a given graph, if any
